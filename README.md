Key Research Questions/ Technological constraints that the Project will Answer

1. What are the current state-of-the-art methods for predicting engine life that are published in the literature? (Benchmarking State of the Art)
2. Areyouabletodeviseabettermethodbycombiningtechniquesfrom multiple papers or implementing your own technique? (ML Model building)
3. Once a model is selected, can this model be readily exposed to end users and services across an enterprise data platform? Can the model be easily updated if improvements are made? (ML Model deployment)


Two datasets for developing the predicting model
Primary: Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset 1 – less data, more examples

Set 1. Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation
Engine degradation simulation was carried out using the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS). Four different sets were simulated under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. This records several sensor channels to characterize fault evolution. The data set was provided by the NASA Ames Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE).

Secondary: Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset 2 – more data, less examples

Set 2. Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation-2
The generation of data-driven prognostics models requires the availability of data sets with run-to-failure trajectories. To contribute to the development of these methods, the data set provides a new realistic data set of run-to-failure trajectories for a small fleet of aircraft engines under realistic flight conditions. The damage propagation modelling used for the generation of this synthetic data set builds on the modeling strategy from previous work. The data set was generated with the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dynamical model. The data set has been provided by the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) in collaboration with ETH Zurich and PARC
